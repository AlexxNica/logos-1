## KharkivJS Mascot

**About the project**<br>
KharkivJS is the community-driven conference that gathers JavaScript developers from all over Ukraine. More that 15 speakers from Finland, Great Britain, Netherlands, Russia, Estonia and Ukraine shared their experience. This year the conference had two streams â€” English and Russian.

The unofficial mascot of the conference is rhino, perhaps as a reference to David Flanagan's well-known book about JavaScript. It was decided to make the mascot more recognizable among the community.
